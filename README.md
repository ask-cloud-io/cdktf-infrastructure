# Infrastructure as code (IAC) is now a first class citizen in the development eco-system
by Ernest Aaron
## a look back...
When most organization think infrastructure as code, they think Terraform.
Terraform is great for managing simple to meduim size infrastructure, but it can be difficult to manage large, complex infrastructure; think multiple accounts, multiple regions, multiple resources, testing all that infrastructure...

Terraform uses a declarative approach, which means that it defines the desired state of infrastructure and then automatically determines the necessary steps to reach that state. This can make it difficult to understand the sequence of events that will occur when applying changes, which can be challenging in complex environments thus making it difficult to manage large, complex infrastructure.
